# Hall-Photon-Theory-in-Mathematica

This is an extension of the known Maxwell equations according to the Hall Photon Theory.
Charles J. Hall, who has worked in Area - 51, has published this theory.
I calculated with Mathematica the changes in the well-known laws of physics
(Gauss' Law of Electricity, Gauss' Law of Magnetism, Faraday's Law, Amp√®re's Law and two new laws, 
according to the Hall Photon Theory).[HallPhotonTheoryInMathematica.pdf](https://github.com/mtaktikos/Hall-Photon-Theory-in-Mathematica/files/10006378/HallPhotonTheoryInMathematica.pdf)
