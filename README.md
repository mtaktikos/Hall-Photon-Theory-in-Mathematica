# Hall-Photon-Theory-in-Mathematica

This is an extension of the known Maxwell equations according to the Hall Photon Theory.
Charles J. Hall, who has worked in Area - 51, has published this theory.
I calculated with Mathematica the changes in the well-known laws of physics
(Gauss' Law of Electricity, Gauss' Law of Magnetism, Faraday's Law, Ampère's Law and two new laws, 
according to the Hall Photon Theory).

## Recent Extensions

The notebook has been extended to include:

1. **Derivation of the Wave Equation** from the extended Maxwell equations
2. **Verification of the Constant Speed of Light** (c = 1/√(ε₀μ₀))
3. **Lorentz Transformations** between inertial reference frames
4. **Electromagnetic Field Transformations** under Lorentz boosts
5. **Star Shine Field Transformations** (specific to Hall Photon Theory)

These additions demonstrate that the Hall Photon Theory extended Maxwell equations are consistent with special relativity and maintain their form (relativistic covariance) in all inertial reference frames.

See [EXTENSION_SUMMARY.md](EXTENSION_SUMMARY.md) for detailed documentation.
